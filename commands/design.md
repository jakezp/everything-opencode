Design and implement frontend UI/UX with the following focus:

1. **Study existing patterns** - Examine the codebase for design systems, component libraries, styling conventions
2. **Commit to a bold direction** - Choose a clear aesthetic (minimal, maximalist, retro, etc.)
3. **Execute with precision** - Match implementation complexity to the vision
4. **Prioritize visual excellence** - Typography, color, motion, spatial composition, visual depth

Load the `frontend-ui-ux` skill for detailed design guidance.

Use Tailwind CSS when available. Create memorable, cohesive interfaces that users love.
